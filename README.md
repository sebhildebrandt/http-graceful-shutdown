**Version 3.0** just released. This version is fully backwards compatible to version 2.x but adds much better handling under the hood.

- can be used with [express][express-url], [koa][koa-url], [fastify][fastify-url], native node [http][http-url], [http2][http2-url] ... see examples
- simple to use
- configurable to your needs
- add your own cleanup function

### Features

`http-graceful-shutdown` manages a secure and save shutdown of your http server application:

- tracks all connections
- stops the server from accepting new connections on shutdown
- graceful communication to all connected clients of server intention to shutdown
- immediately destroys all sockets without an attached HTTP request
- properly handles all HTTP and HTTPS connections
- possibility to define cleanup functions (e.g. closing DB connections)
- preShutdown function if you need to have all HTTP sockets available and untouched
- choose between shutting down by function call or triggered by SIGINT, SIGTERM, ...
- choose between final forcefull process termination node.js (process.exit) or clearing event loop (options).

## Quick Start

### Installation

```bash
$ npm install http-graceful-shutdown
```

### Basic Usage

```js
const gracefulShutdown = require('http-graceful-shutdown');
...
// app: can be http, https, express, koa, fastity, ...
server = app.listen(...);
...

// this enables the graceful shutdown
gracefulShutdown(server);
```

```

1. usually your NODE http server (the black bar in the middle) replies to client requests and sends responses
2. if your server receives a termination signal (e.g. SIGINT - Ctrl-C) from its parent, http-graceful-shutdown starts the shutdown procedure
3. first http-graceful-shutdown will run the "preShutdown" (async) function. Place your own function here (passed to the options object), if you need to have all HTTP sockets available and untouched.
4. then all empty connections are closed and destroyed and
5. http-graceful-shutdown will block any new requests
6. If possible, http-graceful-shutdown communicates to the clients that the server is about to close (connection close header)
7. http-graceful-shutdown now tries to wait till all sockets are finished, then destroys the all remaining sockets
8. now it is time to run the "onShutdown" (async) function (if such a function is passed to the options object)
9. as soon as this onShutdown function has ended, the "finally" (sync) function is executed (if passed to the options)
10. now the event loop cleared up OR process.exit() is triggered (can be defined in the options) and the server process ends.

## Options

| option         | default | Comments |
| -------------- | --------------------- | ---------------------- |
| timeout | 30000 | timeout till forced shutdown (in milli seconds) |
| signals | 'SIGINT SIGTERM' | define the signals, that should be handled (separated by SPACE) |
| development | false | if set to true, no graceful shutdown is proceeded to speed up dev-process |
| preShutdown | - | not time consuming callback function. Needs to return a promise.<br>Here all HTTP sockets are still available and untouched |
| onShutdown | - | not time consuming callback function. Needs to return a promise. |
| forceExit | true | force process.exit - otherwise just let event loop clear |
| finally | - | small, not time consuming function, that will<br>be handled at the end of the shutdown (not in dev-mode) |

### Option Explanation

- **timeout:** You can define the maximum time that the shutdown process may take (timeout option). If after this time, connections are still open or the shutdown process is still running, then the remaining connections will be forcibly closed and the server process is terminated.
- **signals** Here you can define which signals can trigger the shutdown process (SIGINT, SIGTERM, SIGKILL, SIGHUP, SIGUSR2, ...)
- **development** If true, the shutdown process is much shorter, because it just terminates the server, ignoring open connections, shutdown function, finally function ...
- **preShutdown** Place your own (not time consuming) callback function here, if you need to have all HTTP sockets available and untouched during cleanup. Needs to return a promise. (async). If you add an input parameter to your cleanup function (optional), the SIGNAL type that caused the shutdown is passed to your cleanup function. See example.
- **onShutdown** place your (not time consuming) callback function, that will handle your additional cleanup things (e.g. close DB connections). Needs to return a promise. (async). If you add an input parameter to your cleanup function (optional), the SIGNAL type that caused the shutdown is passed to your cleanup function. See example.
- **finally** here you can place a small (not time consuming) function, that will be handled at the end of the shutdown e.g. for logging of shutdown. (sync)
- **forceExit** force process.exit() at the end oof the shutdown process - otherwise just let event loop clear

### Advanced Options Example

You can pass an options-object to specify your specific options for the graceful shutdown

The following example uses all possible options:

```js
const gracefulShutdown = require('http-graceful-shutdown');
...
// app: can be http, https, express, koa, fastity, ...
server = app.listen(...);
...

// your personal cleanup function
// - must return a promise
// - the input parameter is optional (only needed if you want to
//   access the signal type inside this function)
// - this function here in this example takes one second to complete
function shutdownFunction(signal) {
  return new Promise((resolve) => {
    console.log('... called signal: ' + signal);
    console.log('... in cleanup')
    setTimeout(function() {
      console.log('... cleanup finished');
      resolve();
    }, 1000)
  });
}

// finally function
// -- sync function
// -- should be very short (not time consuming)
function finalFunction() {
  console.log('Server gracefulls shutted down.....')
}

// this enables the graceful shutdown with advanced options
gracefulShutdown(server,
  {
    signals: 'SIGINT SIGTERM',
    timeout: 10000,                   // timeout: 10 secs
    development: false,               // not in dev mode
    forceExit: true,                  // triggers process.exit() at the end of shutdown process
    preShutdown: preShutdownFunction, // needed operation before httpConnections are shutted down
    onShutdown: shutdownFunction,     // shutdown function (async) - e.g. for cleanup DB, ...
    finally: finalFunction            // finally function (sync) - e.g. for logging
  }
);
```
### Trigger shutdown manually

You can now trigger gracefulShutdown programatically (e.g. for tests) like so:

```js
let shutdown
beforeAll(() => {
  shutdown = gracefulShutdown(...)
})

afterAll(async () => {
  await shutdown()
})
```

### Do not force process.exit()

With the `forceExit` option, you can define how your node server process ends: when setting `forceExit` to `false`, you just let the event loop clear and then the proccess ends automatically:

```js
const gracefulShutdown = require('http-graceful-shutdown');
...
// app: can be http, https, express, koa, fastity, ...
server = app.listen(...);
...

// enable graceful shutdown with options:
// this option lets the event loop clear to end your node server
// no explicit process.exit() will be triggered.

gracefulShutdown(server, {
  forceExit: false
});
```

If you want an explicit process.exit() at the end, set `forceExit` to `true` (which is the default).

### Debug

If you want to get debug notes ([debug][debug-url] is a dependency of this module), just set the DEBUG environment variable to enable
 debugging:

```
export DEBUG=http-graceful-shutdown
```

OR on Windows:

```
set DEBUG=http-graceful-shutdown
```

## Examples

You can find examples how to use `http-graceful-shutdown` with Express, Koa, http, http2, fastify in the `examples` directory.
To run the examples, be sure to install debug and express, koa or fastify.

```
npm install debug express koa fastify
```
